/**
 * This class helps detecting idle clients.<br>
 * It runs a <b>KeepAliveMessage</b> in a predefined interval.<br>
 * This interval is stored in the attribute <b>keepAliveTimeOut</b> and is
 * defined in the ServerConfiguration. It can be changed, when needed. The
 * server must be restarted to use the new interval. Every client is obliged to
 * send a response to the KeepAliveMessage within that time frame. If it does
 * not, the clients will be disconnected and therefore the game will end.
 * <b>Please note:</b> Do not use a low keepAliveTimeOut. If the user debugs the
 * project, the break point may block the communication between Client and
 * Server, therefore the signals cannot reach the KeepAliveManager. The server
 * will then interpret this as a time out. An interval of one or two minutes
 * (60000 to 120000 ms) is sufficient to detect blocked clients. Is is possible
 * to turn of the KeepAliveManager by setting "UseKeepAliveManager" in the
 * Server Configuration to "false".<br>
 * v1.0 Initial release<br>
 * v1.1 Changing of logging
