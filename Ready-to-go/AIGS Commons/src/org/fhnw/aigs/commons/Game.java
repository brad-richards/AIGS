/**
 * This <b>abstract</b> is the base class of all games on the <b>server</b>
 * side.<br>
 * Do not use this class on the clients. Instead use <b>ClientGam</b>. This
 * class cannot be instantiated directly but must extend another class.<br>
 * The class supports the player with a lot of helper methods like
 * "pickRandomPlayer".<br>
 * If the predefined behaviour does not match your game, override the methods
 * involved. The method "hasEnoughParticipants" for example can differ among
 * games, even though in most cases the basic implementation given in this class
 * will suffice.<br>
 *
 * <strong>VERY Important: Only use an empty constructor!</strong>
 * The class will be automatically loaded. The empty constructor of the
 * inherited class must call Game's constructor. Example:<br>
 * <code>super("TicTacToe", 2, 2);</code>
