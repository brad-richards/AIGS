Compiler troubleshooting
------------------------

In case of building problems...

- Javadoc:
use compiler flag "-Xdoclint:none" to suppress warnings/errors from the very strict jre8 javadoc compilter

- Application / JAR:
use compiler flag "-XDignore.symbol.file=true" if the JAR won't compile.
Especially NetBeans seems to have issues with the package "sun.util.logging".
The compiler aborts the building process in this case with the message. "package sun.util.logging does not exist". Could be a problem of Javac. In Eclipse, the building process seems to work fine.
